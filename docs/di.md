# Dependency Injection (DI)

Dependency Injection follows the Inversion of Control (IoC) design pattern.
By using abstractions this pattern allows software systems to be loosely coupled.

To better understand DI, we can take a look at what an implementation in vanilla JS would look like.
You can find it in [`primitive-injector.ts`](../scripts/primitive-injector.ts).
